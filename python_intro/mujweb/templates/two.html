        <p>Lawrence Gordon Tesler (April 24, 1945 – February 16, 2020) was an American computer scientist who worked in
            the field of human–computer interaction. Tesler worked at Xerox PARC, Apple, Amazon, and Yahoo!</p>
        <p>While at PARC, Tesler's work included Smalltalk, the first dynamic object-oriented programming language, and
            Gypsy, the first word processor with a graphical user interface (GUI) for the Xerox Alto. During this, along
            with colleague Tim Mott, Tesler developed the idea of copy and paste functionality and the idea of modeless
            software. While at Apple, Tesler worked on the Apple Lisa and the Apple Newton, and helped to develop Object
            Pascal and its use in application programming toolkits including MacApp. </p>
